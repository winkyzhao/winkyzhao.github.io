I am currently a researcher in the cryptocurrency industry. My responsibility is to create and evaluate designs of decentralized protocols, e.g., DeFi, DAO, GameFi etc., from both the economic and technical point of view. The goals of research works in this kind are twofold, i.e., a) make sure a protocol is sustainable in a extremely dynamic market; and b) identify the potential flaws of it as early as possible, hopefully before it is launched or someone puts money in it. Before I started my career in cryptocurrency and blockchain, I spent two years in Ant Financial as a software developer working on systems for large-scale financial data analytics. I obtained my master degree at Tsinghua University in 2017 with a major in software engineering. Winky's space is a essentially a platform where I share my highlights at work and interesting research ideas in the context of blockchain, cryptocurrency and web3.
